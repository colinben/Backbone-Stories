        "body_text": "Google Now, the company’s predictive, card-based notification center, isn’t just for relaying the weather outside, the latest baseball scores, and how far you are from home. With its ability to search your Gmail account and Calendar, the service can also tackle some truly useful tasks. For instance, Google recently added the ability set up bills and subscription reminders. For services like Netflix, Comcast, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime, you can use Google Now to remind you to cancel after your free trial period is up. The reminder card will even link directly to the cancellation page. On top of that, Google Now will also dig through your email for bill reminders and will create cards reminding you of upcoming due dates. The card includes who the biller is (your credit card or electric company, for example), the amount due, when it’s due, and the option to view the original email this information was pulled from. This capability is just starting to roll out to folks, so you may not have it quite yet. While Google’s anticipatory abilities can sometimes jump the border into Creepytown, if you fully opt in to the Google way, it does offer some great conveniences. And this is proof.",
