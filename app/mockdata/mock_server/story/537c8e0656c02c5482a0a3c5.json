        "title": "Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers explains Steven Gerrard’s switch",
        "subtitle": "Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says he always planned to shift Steven Gerrard to a deeper midfield role",
        "body_text": "The 33-year-old Reds captain was praised for effortlessly adapting to his new deep-lying midfield role in the second half of the season as the Merseyside outfit mounted a title challenge. Gerrard finished with figures of 13 goals and 13 assists in 34 Premier League appearances – and Liverpool manager Rodgers heaped praise on the England midfielder’s versatility. “I sat with Steven when I first came in, two years ago,” Rodgers told Liverpool’s website. “And I said that this was my vision for him prolonging his career. I felt he had the real quality to play in that role. After that, it was only about timing really. “It was about when we put him in that position. And probably halfway through the season, once I had the players fit that could move and work around him, we changed him and from then he’s been outstanding. “Steven’s a really intelligent player. He’s played really as a more attacking player all his life, but he’s dropped back into that role. It’s still a playmaking position, and he’s started off a number of our attacks from there. “And for him to finish the season like he did was incredible. He goes into the World Cup in great form, and he will be strong next year as well I am sure.”",
