                "subtitle": "A new leak claims to show a rugged Samsung Galaxy S5 Active. Will the S5 get a range of spin-offs just like the S4 did?",
                "body_text": "The S5 could be about to get active. A new leak appears to show a sporting spin-off of the Samsung Galaxy S5 in action. Videos posted online by TK Tech News purport to show an AT&T -- the US network -- version of the S5 Active, alleged to be a follow-up to last year's rugged version of the S4. The Galaxy S4 Active is a reinforced, waterproof, splash-proof phone for sporting types, designed to be taken out on adrenaline-pumping, danger-laced extreme activities like swimming, snowboarding and music festivals. “Upon launch, broadband users in these countries can subscribe to Netflix and instantly watch a curated selection of Hollywood, local and global TV series and movies, including critically-acclaimed Netflix original series, whenever and wherever they like on TVs, tablets, phones, game consoles and computers,” the company said in a release. Incumbent rivals such as France’s FilmoTV have already been readying themselves for Netflix’s arrival, a development that will inevitably shake up the VOD sector across the continent. FilmoTV president Bruno Delecour told Variety in March that while his service wouldn’t be able to compete with Netflix in terms of the number of titles it offers, “we can stand out thanks to the quality of our content,” a factor that he believes “makes FilmoTV different from superstores like Netflix.” In Germany, meanwhile, satellite operator Sky Deutschland has recently launched a Netflix-style service called Snap. Germany and France are two of the world’s top ten broadband markets, so Netflix’s expansion could prove lucrative if it succeeds in making an impact in the two nations. With 134 million broadband subscribers, Western Europe as a whole is hugely important to Netflix. By way of comparison, there are currently around 88 million broadband subscribers in the US. Since launching its streaming service in 2007, the California-based company has built a user base of 48 million subscribers across more than 40 countries. The S5 could be about to get active.

With its ability to search your Gmail account and Calendar, the service can also tackle some truly useful tasks. For instance, Google recently added the ability set up bills and subscription reminders. For services like Netflix, Comcast, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime, you can use Google Now to remind you to cancel after your free trial period is up. The reminder card will even link directly to the cancellation page. On top of that, Google Now will also dig through your email for bill reminders and will create cards reminding you of upcoming due dates. The card includes who the biller is (your credit card or electric company, for example), the amount due, when it’s due, and the option to view the original email this information was pulled from. This capability is just starting to roll out to folks, so you may not have it quite yet. While Google’s anticipatory abilities can sometimes jump the border into Creepytown, if you fully opt in to the Google way, it does offer some great conveniences. And this is proof.",
